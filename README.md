**Note : This is a mini project done for "Programming in C++" course at VIT-AP University. Any plagiarism of any sort complete or partial will be not accepted. The git and commit history and project submission date will be shared as proof.Also it will be easier to trace plagiarist if he/she belongs to the same institute.**

**After going through the code you might have found that there is huge scope for code optimisation ( using correct and efficient data structure and searching algorithm). it was my first mini project on C++ at the end of my first semester. Data Structures and algorithm wasn't taught till then. I deliberatly leave my inital project in a specific language/framework/library unoptimised because its a good way of measuring my progress over a period of time.**
