**Why didn't I optimise the code? **

After going through the code you might have found that there is huge scope for code optimisation ( using correct and efficient data structure and searching algorithm). It was my first mini project on C++ at the end of my first semester. Data Structures and algorithm wasn't taught BY then. I deliberatly leave my inital project in a specific language/framework/library, unoptimised, because its a good way of measuring my progress over a period of time.
